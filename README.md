# amount-of-sugar-in-cereals
This will allow you to choose 2 different types of cereal, and compares the sugar in them. Letting you know which cereal has less sugar. This will help people that love to eat cereal, but dont a lot a of sugar in it. this would make it easier for the person doing the research. The project also contains a graph for visualization. which may be easier for some to read. it will also let you choose to see the fat content and calories that are in the cereals. 
In this project I use git, pandas, amd numpy. as well as matplotlib.
